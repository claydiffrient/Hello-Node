Hello Node is a node.js web application built using the Express web framework.  As the title indicates, it's simply a hello world, but in the full application format to happily introduce the common application structure.

To use, you must install a few things:

Node.js, of course (see http://nodejs.org)
node package manager (see here: http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm)
and then:

  npm install express
  npm install jade
  npm install less
  
the above lines install the express web framework, the jade templating library, and the less css library.

Then, from the home directory of the app:

  node app.js
  
and hit http://localhost:3000 with your browser
